Together
========

Application for simultaneous photo viewing.

All actions made by any of viewers (like going to next photo or open photo list page)
are immediately duplicated in browsers of all other viewers.

## Use case

Once a friend of mine vent to long vacation. He wanted to share some photos and comment on some of those.
We started a skype conversation with screen sharing but video quality was pretty bad.
This application allows to show all photos from directory and synchronize actions of viewers.
Say when friend goes to next photo the same photo is shown to me. So he can tell me about that photo on
skype without having issues with video quality. I can also go to any photo that is interesting for me
and ask him to tell about that one. My actions will be synchronized to him as well.

Please note I'm not considering this as a serious application, more like playground to learn
javascript and node.js.

Compilation script is available in `package.json`. In order to run compilation use

## Development mode

By default server is started in development mode. It starts
[webpack dev server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)
in proxy mode for main server.

Dev server port can be changed by setting `DEV_SERVER_PORT` environment variable.

To disable development server set `NODE_ENV` variable to `production`
